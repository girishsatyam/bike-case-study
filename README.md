## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a 
mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

We will be using Linear Regression to have the variables which are signficant for predicting the demands and how these variables describe the demand.


## Conclusions
-	June, July, Aug, Sep and Oct had high demands for the bike
-	Holiday had less demand in average, maybe because less people going out
-	2019 had a significant demand compared to 2018
-	Summer and Fall had more demand then Spring and Winter
